# LLM Proxy Logging

## Where logs live

Logs are written to two places:

1. **Pod stdout** — available immediately via `kubectl`, lost on pod restart
2. **S3 bucket `logs-open-llm-proxy`** — flushed every 60 seconds (configurable via `FLUSH_INTERVAL` env var) as JSONL chunk files, persisted indefinitely

### S3 layout (tiered rollup)

Three tiers, each holding a different age of data. A daily CronJob rolls
raw JSONL into daily Parquet; a monthly CronJob rolls completed months
of daily Parquet into one monthly Parquet. At any moment:

```
logs-open-llm-proxy/

```

| Tier | Format | When it gets written | When it gets deleted |
|---|---|---|---|
| Raw JSONL (`YYYY-MM-DD/*.jsonl`) | JSONL chunks | Proxy flushes every 60s | Next day's daily consolidation (03:00 UTC) |
| Daily (`consolidated/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.parquet`) | Parquet (zstd) | Daily cron at 03:00 UTC | Monthly rollup on day 2 (04:00 UTC) |
| Monthly (`consolidated/monthly/YYYY-MM.parquet`) | Parquet (zstd) | Monthly cron on day 2 | Never (long-term archive) |
| Session daily (`sessions/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.parquet`) | Parquet (zstd) | Daily cron, derived from that day's consolidated file | Monthly rollup on day 2 |
| Session monthly (`sessions/monthly/YYYY-MM.parquet`) | Parquet (zstd) | Monthly cron on day 2 | Never |

The **consolidated Parquet schema** (identical across daily and monthly tiers). The
hot fields are flattened to typed columns; the raw JSON is kept verbatim in `entry`
for fidelity, so old `entry::JSON->>'…'` / `json_extract_string` queries still work:

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ts` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Extracted from the `timestamp` field of the raw JSON |
| `type` | `VARCHAR` | `'request'` or `'response'` |
| `request_id` | `VARCHAR` | Correlates request ↔ response |
| `session_id` | `VARCHAR` | Per-session id (see field note); `null` in pre-wiring records |
| `origin` | `VARCHAR` | App the traffic came from |
| `client` | `VARCHAR` | e.g. `geo-agent/v3.13.1`; `null` until clients send `X-Client` |
| `provider` | `VARCHAR` | `nrp` / `openrouter` / `nimbus` |
| `model` | `VARCHAR` | Model id |
| `message_count` | `INTEGER` | Request only — messages in the prompt |
| `tools_count` | `INTEGER` | Request only — tools offered |
| `user_question` | `VARCHAR` | Request only — **first** user message (see trap below) |
| `latency_ms` | `BIGINT` | Response only |
| `has_tool_calls` | `BOOLEAN` | Response only |
| `has_content` | `BOOLEAN` | Response only |
| `tool_calls` | `JSON` | Response only — `[{name, arguments}]` |
| `tool_results` | `JSON` | Request only — `tool_results_this_turn` (prior turn's tool outputs) |
| `tokens` | `JSON` | Response only — usage object |
| `error` | `VARCHAR` | Response only — set on failures |
| `entry` | `VARCHAR` | The full original JSON record — parse with `json_extract_string`/`json_extract` |

Columns not applicable to a row's `type` are `null` (e.g. `latency_ms` on a request).
Files written before the flatten landed carry only the legacy 5 columns
(`ts`/`type`/`request_id`/`origin`/`entry`); the monthly rollup reads daily files
with `union_by_name=true` so a mixed month merges cleanly (legacy rows get `null`
for the new columns).

The **session Parquet schema** (`sessions/**`) — one row per turn, request already
joined to its response, so "show me every turn of session X in order, with tool
calls and results" is a single flat `SELECT` with no JSON gymnastics and no manual
request/response interleaving:

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `session_key` | `VARCHAR` | `session_id` when present, else `anon:<md5(origin\|user_question)>` so every turn still groups |
| `session_id` | `VARCHAR` | Raw id (`null` if the heuristic key was used) |
| `turn_idx` | `BIGINT` | 1-based turn order within the session. **Daily files index within-day** (a session crossing UTC midnight restarts at 1 in the next day's file); the monthly view recomputes it over the whole month. Ordering by `request_ts` is always correct regardless. |
| `request_ts` / `response_ts` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Turn start / completion |
| `request_id` | `VARCHAR` | |
| `origin`, `client`, `provider`, `model` | `VARCHAR` | |
| `user_question` | `VARCHAR` | Opening question (same first-message-only caveat) |
| `message_count` | `INTEGER` | |
| `tool_results` | `JSON` | Tool outputs that came *into* this turn |
| `assistant_content` / `reasoning_content` | `VARCHAR` | The model's reply this turn |
| `tool_calls` | `JSON` | Tools the model called *out* this turn |
| `has_tool_calls`, `has_content` | `BOOLEAN` | |
| `latency_ms`, `tokens`, `error` | `BIGINT`/`JSON`/`VARCHAR` | |

> Note: the `consolidated/**` and `sessions/**` globs are disjoint top-level
> prefixes — a `read_parquet('…/consolidated/**/*.parquet')` never picks up session

## Access pattern

### Local sync (recommended for interactive analysis)

The bucket is **private**, but `rclone` already has credentials configured under the `nrp` remote. Sync the bucket to a local scratch dir once per session, then query the local files — no S3 secret, no shell-expanded credentials, and orders of magnitude faster iteration:

```bash
./sync-logs.sh                   # syncs to /tmp/open-llm-proxy-logs
./sync-logs.sh ~/scratch/logs    # or pick your own path
```

The wrapper calls `rclone sync nrp:logs-open-llm-proxy <dest>`. Full sync of the whole bucket is ~1s (it's only a few MiB). Re-syncs during the same session are near-instant because rclone only transfers changed files.

Then query the local path — no `CREATE SECRET` needed:

```bash
duckdb -s "
-- Historical: all consolidated data in one read (daily + monthly Parquet)
SELECT ts, entry::JSON->>'user_question' AS q
FROM read_parquet('/tmp/open-llm-proxy-logs/consolidated/**/*.parquet')
WHERE entry::JSON->>'origin' = 'https://tpl.nrp-nautilus.io'
  AND ts > now() - INTERVAL 7 DAYS;

-- Today's live data (raw JSONL — narrow the glob to an hour when possible)
SELECT * FROM read_ndjson_auto(
  '/tmp/open-llm-proxy-logs/2026-04-17/*.jsonl', union_by_name=true);

-- Pair requests and responses from consolidated Parquet
SELECT req.ts, req.entry::JSON->>'user_question' AS q,
       resp.entry::JSON->'tool_calls' AS tools,
       (resp.entry::JSON->>'latency_ms')::INT AS ms
FROM read_parquet('/tmp/open-llm-proxy-logs/consolidated/**/*.parquet') req
JOIN read_parquet('/tmp/open-llm-proxy-logs/consolidated/**/*.parquet') resp
  ON req.request_id = resp.request_id
WHERE req.type = 'request' AND resp.type = 'response';
"
```

Live data caveat: raw JSONL for today is only as fresh as the last `./sync-logs.sh`. Re-run it before querying if you care about the last few minutes. For sub-minute freshness, use `kubectl` (below) or the direct-S3 path.

For queries that span today + history, UNION raw JSONL and consolidated Parquet with a shared projection (cast JSONL rows' `timestamp` to `TIMESTAMPTZ` and wrap the full row back into JSON if needed).

### Direct S3 (one-shot queries, automation, or inside NRP pods)

When you don't want a local copy — e.g. a single CI query, a k8s job, or always-current reads inside a pod — query S3 directly with a DuckDB secret. Set `LOG_S3_KEY` and `LOG_S3_SECRET` in your shell (scoped keys for this bucket — distinct from your general NRP credentials) and let the shell expand them. Agents should use the Bash tool so shell expansion keeps the secret values out of the conversation transcript.

```bash
duckdb -s "
CREATE SECRET logs_s3 (TYPE S3, KEY_ID '$LOG_S3_KEY', SECRET '$LOG_S3_SECRET',
  ENDPOINT 's3-west.nrp-nautilus.io', USE_SSL true, URL_STYLE 'path');

SELECT ts, entry::JSON->>'user_question' AS q
FROM read_parquet('s3://logs-open-llm-proxy/consolidated/**/*.parquet')
WHERE ts > now() - INTERVAL 7 DAYS;
"
```

**Narrow the raw JSONL glob to the current hour** (e.g. `2026-04-17/14-*.jsonl`) — do NOT scan the whole day. `union_by_name=true` handles schema drift across chunks (e.g. the `error` column appears only in some files). If the queried window has zero error responses, `error` is absent from all files — omit it from JOIN queries or use `TRY(resp.error)`.

**Temporal filter:** `timestamp` is stored as VARCHAR (ISO8601). Cast to `TIMESTAMPTZ` (not `TIMESTAMP`) when comparing against `now()`:
```sql
CAST(req.timestamp AS TIMESTAMPTZ) >= now() - INTERVAL 20 MINUTES
```
Using `TIMESTAMP` causes a type mismatch binder error because `now()` returns `TIMESTAMPTZ`.

**Log field truncation:** As of the training-grade logging change, the response `content`/`reasoning_content` are captured **in full** (use them, not the 200-char `*_preview` fields), and `tool_results_this_turn[N].content` is capped at 20000 chars (`LOG_TOOL_RESULT_MAX`). **Records written before that change** still have only a 200-char `content_preview` and 500-char tool results — for those, a tool result that appears to contain only column names likely has full descriptions below the truncation point; verify using the STAC MCP tools directly rather than inferring from old previews.

**Transient "malformed JSON" errors on raw JSONL:** Occasionally a `read_ndjson_auto` over today's directory will fail with `unexpected control character in string` at some byte offset. This is almost always a spurious partial byte-range read between DuckDB's httpfs extension and the Ceph gateway under high-parallelism scans — not actual bad data. The proxy writes with `json.dumps` (which escapes every control char) and S3 PUTs are atomic, so malformed lines on disk are not possible from the normal write path. The local-sync workflow avoids this entirely (it's only observed against `s3://` reads). If you're on the direct-S3 path: retry the query, or pass `ignore_errors=true` to `read_ndjson_auto` if you want a tolerant scan:
```sql
read_ndjson_auto('s3://.../YYYY-MM-DD/*.jsonl', union_by_name=true, ignore_errors=true)
```
Do not treat this as a proxy bug unless you can point at an actual byte with a raw control character in a file that's not being actively written.

Inside NRP pods, use the internal endpoint instead (`rook-ceph-rgw-nautiluss3.rook`, `USE_SSL false`) — faster and no public-endpoint throttling.

### kubectl (live logs / last ~60s before next flush)

Pod stdout is **compacted**: each field is bounded to ~200 chars
(`LOG_STDOUT_MAX_FIELD`) and the full `messages` array (full mode) is omitted —
so `kubectl logs` stays readable and isn't flooded by large prompts/responses.
The **complete, untruncated** record is in S3; use that for anything beyond a
live glance. (When S3 is disabled, stdout falls back to the full record since
it's then the only sink.) `origin`/`request_id`/`type` are never shrunk, so the
grep filters below still work.

```bash
# Live tail
kubectl -n biodiversity logs deployment/open-llm-proxy -f

# Recent history
kubectl -n biodiversity logs deployment/open-llm-proxy --tail=500

# Filter to a specific app
kubectl -n biodiversity logs deployment/open-llm-proxy --tail=1000 \
  | grep '"origin":"https://padus.nrp-nautilus.io"'
```

## Logging fidelity & credential scrubbing

The proxy logs are used as an evaluation/training corpus (see the `agent_runner_*`
origins), so capture is **training-grade**, controlled by `LOG_CAPTURE_MODE`:

| Mode | What's captured | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `summary` (default) | Full response `content`/`reasoning_content`, generously-capped `user_question` and tool results, full `tool_calls`. **No** raw prompt. | Observability + most analysis; the response target is faithful. |
| `full` | Everything in `summary`, **plus** the entire `messages` array per request (system prompt de-duplicated by hash). | Reconstructing exact `(messages → completion)` training pairs. |

Caps are tunable per field via env vars (`0` = uncapped): `LOG_CONTENT_MAX`
(final answer, default 0), `LOG_REASONING_MAX` (thinking trace, default 4000),
`LOG_TOOL_RESULT_MAX` (default 20000), `LOG_USER_QUESTION_MAX` (default 4000).
Capture mode and per-field caps are **orthogonal**: capture mode controls how
much of the *prompt* (`messages`) is kept; caps bound each *output field*.
`tool_calls` arguments (the SQL the model wrote) are always kept in full. The
default config therefore keeps full tool calls + full final answer but bounds
the bulky reasoning trace — set `LOG_REASONING_MAX=0` to capture it in full.

Logging is wrapped so a failure (e.g. a scrubbing/serialisation edge case) can
never break request serving — it logs a `⚠️ … failed (request still served)`
breadcrumb to stdout and the upstream call proceeds normally.

**Credential scrubbing is always on, in both modes.** The geo-agent `query` MCP
tool takes `s3_key`/`s3_secret` in its arguments, which flow through `tool_calls`,
tool results, and (in `full` mode) `messages`. Before anything is logged the proxy
redacts: values under credential-looking keys (`s3_secret`, `s3_key`, `api_key`,
`password`, `token`, …), DuckDB `KEY_ID '…'` / `SECRET '…'` literals, and
`Authorization: Bearer …` tokens — replacing them with `[REDACTED]`. This is
exercised by `test_logging.py`. **Note:** the live scrubber only protects records
written *after* this change; older Parquet still contains leaked secrets. The
one-off **`scrub-historical-logs.py`** job (manifest: `scrub-historical-logs-job.yaml`)
rewrites those historical S3 objects in place using the *same* `scrub.py` logic,
so the corpus is safe to share. It is idempotent (re-runs are no-ops), preserves
JSON semantics (only the `entry` `tool_calls`/tool-result fields change), and
rewrites Parquet via a temp key + row-count check + atomic copy. Run `--dry-run`
first, then `--verify` for the real pass. Validated against the current bucket:
184 leaking rows → 0, with zero data loss on the rest.

**Size note:** `summary` mode is comparable to the old format (a few MiB/year; the
extra full-content bytes compress well under Parquet zstd). `full` mode is far
larger — each turn carries the whole conversation (~23k prompt tokens avg), so the
system-prompt dedup (which removes the dominant repeated ~22k-token blob) is what
keeps it tractable. With multiple uvicorn workers the dedup set is per-process, so
each distinct system prompt is logged once per worker.

## Log format

Each LLM call produces two JSON entries on stdout: a `REQUEST` line when the call arrives and a `RESPONSE` line when it completes.

### REQUEST entry

```
📥 REQUEST: {"timestamp": "...", "type": "request", ...}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `timestamp` | UTC ISO8601 |
| `type` | `"request"` |
| `request_id` | 8-char hex — correlates this request to its response |
| `provider` | `"nrp"`, `"openrouter"`, or `"nimbus"` |
| `model` | Model name as sent by the client |
| `origin` | Origin or Referer header — identifies which app sent the request |
| `client` | `X-Client` header — client app + version, e.g. `geo-agent/v3.13.1`. `null` until the client sends it. Correlates logged behavior with a specific release. |
| `session_id` | Stable per-browser-session id that ties together every turn **and every follow-up question** of one user session. Sourced from the request body's OpenAI `user` field (geo-agent already sends its per-session UUID there), falling back to the `X-Session-Id` header. **`null` in records written before this was wired up** (see wiring note below) — for those, fall back to the `(origin, user_question)` heuristic and mind the `user_question` caveat. |
| `message_count` | Total messages in the conversation at this turn |
| `tools_count` | Number of tools available to the LLM |
| `user_question` | First `role: user` message in the conversation. ⚠️ **First-message-only — this is a trap.** It is the human's *original* opening question and is stable across all turns of a tool-use loop, but it does **not** update when the user asks a follow-up in the same session. A session where the user opens with "Tell me about datasets" and later asks "now map the hardwood woodland" logs **both** turns under `user_question = "Tell me about datasets"`; the follow-up text lives only inside the `messages` array (`full` mode) and is invisible to any `user_question` filter. To find follow-ups, full-text-search the whole record or capture `session_id`. Capped at `LOG_USER_QUESTION_MAX` chars (default 4000). |
| `tool_results_this_turn` | Array of `{tool_call_id, content}` for any `role: tool` messages appended since the last assistant turn. Captures results from both local geo-agent tools (e.g. `list_datasets`, `get_dataset_details`) and remote MCP tools (e.g. `query`). Each `content` is capped at `LOG_TOOL_RESULT_MAX` chars (default 20000). `null` on the first turn. |
| `messages` | **Only when `LOG_CAPTURE_MODE=full`.** The entire scrubbed `messages` array sent to the provider — training-grade fidelity. The large system prompt is de-duplicated: each `role: system` message is replaced by `{role, system_sha256, content_len, _dedup: true}` and the full body is emitted once (per worker) as a separate `type: "system_prompt"` entry. Join `messages[].system_sha256` → the `system_prompt` entry to rehydrate. |

### RESPONSE entry

```
✓ RESPONSE: {"timestamp": "...", "type": "response", ...}
✗ RESPONSE: {"timestamp": "...", "type": "response", "error": "...", ...}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `timestamp` | UTC ISO8601 |
| `type` | `"response"` |
| `request_id` | Matches the corresponding request entry |
| `provider` | Provider that handled the request |
| `model` | Model used |
| `origin` | Same as request — identifies which app |
| `client` | Same as request — `X-Client` header (client app + version), `null` until sent |
| `session_id` | Same as request — per-session id from the `user` body field / `X-Session-Id` header |
| `latency_ms` | End-to-end latency in milliseconds |
| `has_content` | Whether the LLM returned text content |
| `has_tool_calls` | Whether the LLM made tool calls |
| `has_reasoning_content` | Whether the LLM returned a separate `reasoning_content` field (qwen3 thinking-mode and similar). A response with `has_content=false` and `has_reasoning_content=true` means the model spent its budget reasoning but never emitted a final answer — diagnostic for degenerate-200 cases. |
| `content` | **Full** text response (the training target), scrubbed of credentials. Capped only if `LOG_CONTENT_MAX > 0` (default 0 = uncapped). |
| `reasoning_content` | **Full** `reasoning_content` (qwen3 thinking-mode etc.), scrubbed. Empty for non-thinking models. |
| `content_preview` | First 200 chars of `content` — kept for cheap kubectl/SQL scans. |
| `reasoning_content_preview` | First 200 chars of `reasoning_content`. |
| `tool_calls` | Array of `{name, arguments}` — full tool call arguments including SQL query strings. Credential args (`s3_key`/`s3_secret`/…) are redacted. |
| `tokens` | Token usage object from the provider (`prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`) |
| `error` | Error detail string (only present on failed requests) |

### Wiring up `session_id`

`session_id` is populated server-side from two sources, in priority order:

1. **The OpenAI `user` request-body field (primary).** geo-agent's `Agent` mints
   one `crypto.randomUUID()` per instance (`this.sessionId`) and already sends it
   as `user` on every `/chat/completions` POST. The proxy reads `request.user`
   into `session_id` (`llm_proxy.py`) and logs it — but does **not** forward `user`
   upstream, so provider-side caching/abuse-monitoring is unaffected. This required
   no client change and lights up all existing geo-agent traffic.
2. **The `X-Session-Id` header (fallback).** For non-geo-agent clients that prefer
   a header. It is in the ingress `cors-allow-headers` allow-list (`ingress.yaml`);
   CORS is enforced at the ingress, not the app, so any custom header must be
   listed there or the browser preflight blocks the whole request (same gotcha as
   `X-Client` in #26).

Records written before this wiring have `session_id = null`; group those by the
`(origin, user_question)` heuristic instead. For newer records, group by
`session_id` for exact session reconstruction — it is immune to the
`user_question` first-message-only trap and survives follow-up questions.

## Reconstructing a conversation

> what the session view itself is built from.

Each POST to `/v1/chat/completions` is one LLM turn. A single user session produces multiple request/response pairs. To reconstruct a session:

1. Match by `origin` to isolate one app
2. Group turns by `user_question` (same question = same session)
3. Sort by `timestamp`
4. Interleave: each request's `tool_results_this_turn` shows what the previous turn's tool calls returned; each response's `tool_calls` shows what the LLM decided to call next

Use `request_id` to pair each request with its response when log lines are interleaved under concurrent load.

> ⚠️ **`user_question` groups by *opening* question, not by session.** Step 2 is a heuristic with two failure modes: (a) two different users who happen to open with the same question collapse into one apparent session, and (b) a single user's **follow-up questions never get their own group** — they stay pinned to the opening `user_question` (see the field note above). When `session_id` is populated, group by it instead — it is exact and survives follow-ups. Until then, treat a single `user_question` group as "one opening question and everything that followed it," not "one atomic question."

> 📋 **Brittle-JSON caveat (consolidated Parquet).** `entry::JSON->>'field'` intermittently throws `Conversion Error: Failed to cast value to numerical` — DuckDB mis-infers an all-`null` or numeric-looking JSON path and tries to cast the whole `entry` blob. It is load-bearing-flaky: the same expression works in a bare `SELECT` but fails inside a `GROUP BY`/aggregate. Use `json_extract_string(entry, '$.field')` (for text) and `json_extract(entry, '$.field')` (for JSON) instead — they never throw.

## Example session reconstruction

```
REQUEST  msg=2  user_question="Tell me about datasets"  tool_results=null
RESPONSE tool_calls=[{name: list_datasets, arguments: {}}]

REQUEST  msg=4  user_question="Tell me about datasets"  tool_results=[{content: "[{id: pad-us...}]"}]
RESPONSE tool_calls=[{name: get_schema, arguments: {dataset_id: "pad-us-4.1-fee"}}]

REQUEST  msg=6  user_question="Tell me about datasets"  tool_results=[{content: "path: s3://... | column | sample..."}]
RESPONSE has_content=true  content_preview="The PAD-US dataset contains..."
```

Note: `list_datasets` and `get_schema` are local geo-agent tools — their results appear in `tool_results_this_turn` on the proxy but never reach the MCP server.

## What the MCP server logs add

The DuckDB MCP server logs SQL execution separately. MCP logs are only needed for:
- SQL execution errors not visible to the LLM (failed queries that return an error string)
- Exact query timing at the database layer

For conversation-level analysis (what users asked, what the LLM decided, what tools returned), proxy logs are self-sufficient.
